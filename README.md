Explains the work done by our team **Beavers Intelligence Unit** for the **2025 IBM TechXchange Pre-Conference WatsonX Hackathon**. The goal of the hackathon is the use agentic AI to create an innovative solve to an everyday, real-world problem. This project was completed using Javascript, css, and html.

ECHOVisit is an AI agent, powered by WatsonX AI's Granite models, that turns a doctor’s quick verbal description of a case into a standardized, shareable visit summary. Clinicians simply record a brief spoken note; our system transcribes the audio, extracts and organizes clinical data (symptoms, diagnosis, meds, instructions), and rewrites it in plain language for patients, and translates it to languages other than English on patient request. The product is a web-based platform, which includes two connected portals — one for clinicians and one for patients.


# Why is ECHOVisit Useful?
ECHOVisit cuts clinicians’ documentation overhead and improves patient follow-through. Clinicians spend less time writing notes, patients get clear, plain-language visit records, translations when needed, and an integrated AI-enabled chat for asking medicine-related questions, and both parties can use the same standardized summary for follow-up, referrals, or EHR imports.

# Features
## Clinician-facing
- **Quick verbal input** — Clinicians record a short spoken case description.  
- **Lightweight note editing & approval** — Transcribed and AI-extracted summaries are shown to clinicians for review and sign-off before publishing to the patient.  
- **EHR-ready export** — Structured JSON output (EHR/FHIR-friendly) for integrations, referrals, and analytics.

## Automated backend (what the system does)
- **Speech → Text** — Accurate audio transcription with timestamps and speaker metadata.  
- **Information extraction** — Pulls structured data (chief complaint, symptoms, vitals, diagnosis, medications, instructions).  
- **Simplification & translation** — Generates plain-language patient summaries and translated variants on demand.  
- **Medication checks** — Flags potential drug–drug interactions and allergy conflicts.  
- **Health flagging** — Detects out-of-range vitals (e.g., BP, BMI) with configurable thresholds and highlights them for clinician review.  
- **Audit & traceability** — Full change history for clinician edits and approvals.

## Patient-facing
- **Plain-language visit summary** — Easy-to-read summary of the visit with key action items.  
- **Integrated AI chat** — Patients can ask follow-up questions about diagnoses, meds, or instructions; responses can be translated.  
- **Share & download** — Patients can export the visit summary or share it with caregivers.

## Safety, privacy & ops
- **Clinician control** — All patient-visible content is gated by clinician approval.  
- **Configurable rules** — Thresholds for flags and interaction checks can be tuned per clinic.  
- **Security & compliance** — Encrypted storage, role-based access, and audit logs (design with HIPAA/organizational requirements in mind).

# Conclusion
ECHOVisit was an idea solely created for the 2025 IBM TechXchange Pre-Conference WatsonX Hackathon. However, we truly believe in its potential and want to build upon our initial ideas. We envision adding more features to improve its practicality and efficiency to further improve user experience. Overall, it was a great experience and challenge to build ECHOVisit up to this point.
