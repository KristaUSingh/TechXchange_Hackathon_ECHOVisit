Explains the work done by our team **Beavers Intelligence Unit** for the **2025 IBM TechXchange Pre-Conference WatsonX Hackathon**. The goal of the hackathon is the use agentic AI to create an innovative solve to an everyday, real-world problem. This project was completed using Javascript, css, and html.

ECHOVisit is an AI agent, powered by WatsonX AI's Granite models, that turns a doctor’s quick verbal description of a case into a standardized, shareable visit summary. Clinicians simply record a brief spoken note; our system transcribes the audio, extracts and organizes clinical data (symptoms, diagnosis, meds, instructions), and rewrites it in plain language for patients, and translates it to languages other than English on patient request. The product is a web-based platform, which includes two connected portals — one for clinicians and one for patients.


# Why is ECHOVisit Useful?
ECHOVisit cuts clinicians’ documentation overhead and improves patient follow-through. Clinicians spend less time writing notes, patients get clear, plain-language visit records, translations when needed, and an integrated AI-enabled chat for asking medicine-related questions, and both parties can use the same standardized summary for follow-up, referrals, or EHR imports.

# Features
## 1. Voice Recording
- Healthcare providers can record their notes after appointments for maximum efficiency
> Simple notes such as vitals can be typed into the portal
## 2. Audio Transcription
- A speech-to-text feature that provides a written form of the healthcare providers' notes
## 3. Translation
- Translates the notes provided to the patient into a language other than English if needed
## 4. AI Agent
- Extracts relevant information and organizes it into structured categories
> Healthcare providers must review and approve it before the data can be viewed on the patient's portal
- Patients will be provided an easy to understand summary of the notes from their visit
- Patients will be provided with initial questions that they can ask
- Patients can ask questions regarding anything pertaining to their health and doctor's visit
> The conversation can be translated too!
- If medication that the patient was prescribed has any **drug interactions** with any medication that the patient is currently taking it will be flagged
## 5. Health Flagging
- The patient's **blood pressure** will be flagged if it is outside of a normal range
- The patient's **BMI** will be flagged if it is outside the normal or healthy range
> Both healthcare providers and patients will have access to this information. However, the doctor can change this if necessary.

# Conclusion
ECHOVisit was an idea solely created for the 2025 IBM TechXchange Pre-Conference WatsonX Hackathon. However, we truly believe in its potential and want to build upon our initial ideas. We envision adding more features to improve its practicality and efficiency to further improve user experience. Overall, it was a great experience and challenge to build ECHOVisit up to this point.
